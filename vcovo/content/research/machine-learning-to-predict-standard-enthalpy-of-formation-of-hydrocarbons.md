## Abstract
Thermodynamic properites of molecules are used widely in the study of reactive processes. Such properties are typically measured via experiments or calculated by a variety of computational chemistry methods. In this work, machine learning (ML) models for estimation of standard enthalpy of formation at 298.15 K are developed for three classes of acyclic and closed-shell hydrocarbons, viz. alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes. Initially, an extensive literature survey is performed to collect standard enthalpy data for training ML models. A commercial software (Dragon) is used to obtain a wide set of molecular descriptors by providing SMILES strings. The molecular descriptors are used as input features for the ML models. Support vector regression (SVR) and artificial neural networks are used with a two-level K-fold cross-validation (K-fold CV) workflow. The first level is for estimation of accuracy of both the ML models, and the second level is for generation of the final models. The SVR model is selected as the best model based on error estimates over 10-fold CV. The final SVR model is compared against conventional Bensonâ€™s group additivity for a set of octene isomers from the database, illustrating the advantages of the proposed ML modeling approach.
