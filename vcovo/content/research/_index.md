This work was done in collaboration with **King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)**. Research started through a student program which I took on as one of my internships while studying at the **University of Waterloo**. After succesful initial research I was invited back as a consultant to create numerous more Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for various combustion phenomena.

Once I started studying Computer Science at the **Technical University of Delft** I continued working and advising as an independent researcher. I did this out of curiosity and because my work provided the foundation for numerous other projects.
