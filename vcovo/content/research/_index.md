This work was done in collaboration with [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/). Research started through a student program which I took on as one of my internships while studying at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). After succesful initial research I was invited back as a consultant to create numerous more Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for various combustion phenomena.

Once I started studying Computer Science at the [Technical University of Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/) I continued working and advising as an independent researcher. I did this out of curiosity and because my work provided the foundation for numerous other projects.
